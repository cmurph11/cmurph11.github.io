	<h4>Hi, I'm Colin Murphy. Currently I'm a freshman at pursuing a BA from Tufts University in computer science and a BFA in Studio art at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, with a focus in photography. Within studio art, I'm really interested in the intersection of tech, the arts, and culture, particularly with personal representation on social media and other web interfaces.</h4>
